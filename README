There's probably a better way to do this but the following serves my purposes:

vim ~/.bash_profile
#add ~/tools/lib to your path

mkdir ~/tools/lib
cd ~/tools/lib
git clone git@github.com:unflores/merge_subtitles.git
cd ../
ln -s lib/merge_subtitles/bin/merge_subtitles ./merge_subtitles


Oh right, then go to the dir with the two subtitle files needing a good merging and put:

merge_subtitles file1.sub file2.sub merged_file

That is all.
